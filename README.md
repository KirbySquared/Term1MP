# Term1MP

This machine project is a simple program that guesses the next numbers if a pattern is detected, and from a menu you can pick a sequence along with how many numbers to print, and which number to start on. 
This project is made with limitations and can be viewed via the mpNumbers.pdf.
To run this machine project, download all files, and run the mpMain.c in a cmd; all files must be in the same location.
